1. position and velocity are not initialized. 
Fix: 
double position = 0.0;
double velocity = 0.0;
2. Arguments are ints instead of doubles. this.position should be this->position instead (same for velocity). Missing semicolon at the end.
Projectile(double position, double velocity) {
    this->position = position;
    this->velocity = velocity;
};
3.
  a) method returns a pointer to an int and takes an argument arg, a pointer to an int
  b) method returns a pointer to a constant int and takes an argument arg, a pointer to an int
  c) method returns a constant pointer to a constant and takes an argument arg, a pointer to an int
  d) method returns a constant pointer to a constant and takes an argument arg, a pointer to a constant int
  e) constant method returns a constant pointer to a constant and takes an argument arg, a pointer to a constant int
5. References do not give you the numerical value of the memory address and references cannot point to different addresses.
10. Const keyword to method parametes doesn't make any functional difference to non-pointers/references because the function makes a copy of the parameter not affecting what was passed.
