1. position and velocity are not initialized. 
Fix: 
double position = 0.0;
double velocity = 0.0;
2. Arguments are ints instead of doubles. this.position should be this->position instead (same for velocity). Missing semicolon at the end.
Projectile(double position, double velocity) {
    this->position = position;
    this->velocity = velocity;
};

5. References do not give you the numerical value of the memory address and references cannot point to diff
