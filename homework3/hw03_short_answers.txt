6. The & operator retrieve the pointer of a variable, and the * (dereference) operator gets the value from the pointer.
9. Describe what each of the following declare:
   a) int* a; // Declares pointer a that points to an int. 
   b) const int b; // Declares int b a constant (immutable)
   c) const int* c; // Declares pointer c that points to a constant int 
   d) int* const d; // Declares constant pointer d that points to an int
   e) const int* const e; // Declares constant pointer e that points to a constant int
12. Variable x2 goes out of scope and is deleted. 
Here is the fixed code:
void powers(double x, double* x2_ptr, double* x3_ptr) {
    *x2_ptr = x * x;
    *x3_ptr = x * x * x;
}
Instead of pointer return function, make a void function that overwrites both pointers.
Use a void function and the
