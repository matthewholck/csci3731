1. Java handles arrays as objects while C/C++ handle arrays as pointers
2. Another way to print list[6] would be pointing to list + 6
5. To get a subarray of third to sixth elements from an array with 128 indexes using function:
void f(int* array, int length) would be to pass arguments a[2] and length=4
6.  The copy char array allocates eight elements of memory, what will happen is once copy is run on string 'hello', the last element of allocation is unknown and can be exploited to insert malicious input. TO fix this you would in
13. Data allocated to the stack is only allocated to the local data it is working with. Heap data is allocated until explicitly deleted.
