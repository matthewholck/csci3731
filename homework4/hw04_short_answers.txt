1. Java handles arrays as objects while C/C++ handle arrays as pointers
2. Another way to print list[6] would be pointing to list + 6
5. To get a subarray of third to sixth elements from an array with 128 indexes using function:
void f(int* array, int length) would be to pass arguments a[2] and length=4
6.  The copy char array does not close with '\0' meaning that its remaining indexes that were not copied from string will hold and print garbage. To fix this afer copying stirng, add the '\0'.
13. Data allocated to the stack is only allocated to the local data it is working with. Heap data is allocated until explicitly deleted.
